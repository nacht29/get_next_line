This project will not only allow you to add a very convenient function to your collection, 
but it will also make you learn a highly interesting 
new concept in C programming: static 
variables.

Yachan printf code is good and rigorous overall . There 
are some improvements to be made on his code readability when it comes to your Makefile formatting, variable naming, and file naming. Try to use more descriptive names for variables 
(eg: hex-hexa, out-address, !s - s==NULL).
Consistent spacing in your Makefile and consistent file name 
conventions (eg: instead of put_uint, name it as putuint or vice 
versa, convert everything to put_chr, put_nbr and so on). These 
practices will help other devs understand your code a lot better
 during 
collaboration and help future you too whenever you need to refer back 
to your code. The uintptr_t type is something new to me, which makes a 
lot of sense to be used as the proper data type for pointers as I was 
struggling to set logical data type. And checking for the type of OS 
to determine null values for string and the valid formats for printf is 
something I never thought of which was really cool to see! Keep up the
 good work!
