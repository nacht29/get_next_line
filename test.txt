By giving a child a book, you are not only giving them a smile but helping improve their literacy. In addition, current studies show that “reading to hospitalized children increases their 
oxytocin and reduces their pain and stress. During storytelling, something happens called “narrative transportation.” The child, through fantasy, can experience sensations and thoughts that 
transport them to another world, a place different from the hospital room and far from the adverse conditions.” Research from D’Or Institute for Research and Education.
